# Swarm Drones Formation Challenge

This repository implements and evaluates centralized and decentralized multi-drone formation strategies across four progressively complex scenarios, using ROS 2, Aerostack2, and Crazyflie quadrotors. Detailed descriptions, hyperparameter analyses, performance metrics, and discussion of trade-offs are drawn from our full coursework report. For folder-specific launch, configuration, and detailed usage, please see the individual README.md files in each source directory (e.g., `src/aerostack2/README.md`, `src/challenge_multi_drone/README.md`).

### Stage 1 â€“ Adaptive Formation Patterns

**Scenario:**  
Five drones follow a circular 12 m radius trajectory at 2 m altitude, switching among six predefined patterns (Line, V, Diamond, Circle, Grid, Staggered) every 30Â°.

#### Centralized Approach
- **Script:** `mission_stage1_centralised.py`
- **Control Strategy:** Leader-follower model where a single node computes trajectories for all drones and broadcasts commands, ensuring tight temporal coordination.
- **Key Hyperparameters:**
  - Waypoint Angular Step (Î”Î¸): 30Â°
  - Drone Speed: 0.7 m/s
  - Stabilization Pause: 0.5 s
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Mission Time: 136.3 s
  - Max Formation Error: 2.25 m
  - Total CPU Load: 423.9 s (on the leader node)
- **Observations:**  
  Provides excellent synchronization and precision, completing the mission faster with lower formation error. However, it concentrates the entire computational load on one drone, creating a single point of failure.

#### Decentralized Approach
- **Script:** `mission_stage1_decentralised.py`
- **Control Strategy:** Each drone runs an identical autonomy stack, using a swarm-wide heartbeat (20 Hz) and a leader-election protocol to achieve consensus on formation and trajectory phase.
- **Key Hyperparameters:**
  - Heartbeat Rate: 20 Hz
  - Leader Election Timeout: 0.6 s
  - Drone Speed: 0.7 m/s
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Mission Time: ~215.0 s
  - Max Formation Error: 4.70 m
  - Total CPU Load: ~55.0 s (across 5 agents)
- **Observations:**  
  Significantly more robustâ€”loss of the leader triggers re-election without halting the mission. Trade-off is longer mission time and greater formation error due to communication latency.

### Stage 2 â€“ Passage Through Narrow Apertures

**Scenario:**  
A swarm of five drones traverses two narrow, 1.5 m-wide windows positioned 8 m apart, requiring reconfiguration from a line formation to a vertical stack and back.

#### Centralized Approach
- **Script:** `mission_stage2_central.py`
- **Control Strategy:** Leader drone detects proximity to the window (1.2 m) and triggers a formation switch for the entire swarm using pre-computed offsets.
- **Key Hyperparameters:**
  - Speed: 3.0 m/s
  - Controller Timestep (dt): 0.3 s
  - Formation Switch Threshold: 1.2 m
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Success Rate: 100%
  - Total Mission Time: 89.5 s
  - Switch Latency: 3.6 s
- **Observations:**  
  Executes formation switches very quickly and cohesively due to a single command source, resulting in low latency.

#### Decentralized Approach
- **Script:** `mission_stage2_decentralized.py`
- **Control Strategy:** Each drone uses an Artificial Potential Field (APF) to navigate. Repulsive forces from window edges (k_rep = 0.8) and attractive forces toward the goal guide each agent independently.
- **Key Hyperparameters:**
  - APF Attractive Gains (k_x, k_y): 1.1, 0.8
  - APF Repulsive Gain (k_rep): 0.8
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Success Rate: 100%
  - Total Mission Time: 83.6 s
  - Reformation Time: 17.4 s
- **Observations:**  
  Faster overall mission and reformation due to local, parallel adjustments. Introduces higher jitter and slightly increased switch latency.

### Stage 3 â€“ Dense Forest Traversal

**Scenario:**  
Navigate a 20Ã—20 m area cluttered with 20 randomly placed cylindrical obstacles (radius 0.5 m). Drones must switch formations in safe zones to pass.

#### Centralized Approach
- **Script:** `mission_stage3_central.py`
- **Control Strategy:** Leader plans a path for the entire swarm using an APF planner (10 Hz), applying repulsive forces from trees and between drones.
- **Key Hyperparameters:**
  - Repulsive Gains: Tree = 30, Neighbor = 15
  - Waypoint Smoothing Look-ahead: 0.8
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Success Rate: 100%
  - Total Time: 93.7 s
  - Reformation Time: 26.0 s
- **Observations:**  
  Avoids local minima reliably, but reactive path corrections affect the whole swarm, leading to longer mission and reformation times.

#### Decentralized Approach
- **Script:** `mission_stage3_decentralized.py`
- **Control Strategy:** Each agent independently plans its path using RRT and applies local potential field corrections for obstacles within 1.2 m.
- **Key Hyperparameters:**
  - RRT Step Size: 0.5 m
  - RRT Goal Bias: 0.2
  - Local Correction Radius: 1.2 m
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Success Rate: 100%
  - Total Time: 58.7 s
  - Reformation Time: 5.7 s
- **Observations:**  
  Parallel RRT planning speeds traversal and concurrent local adjustments yield very fast reformation. Higher per-agent CPU load is the trade-off.

### Stage 4 â€“ Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance

**Scenario:**  
Five drones maintain a V-formation while avoiding five unpredictably moving balloons in a 15Ã—15 m arena.

#### Centralized Approach
- **Script:** `mission_stage4_centralised.py`
- **Control Strategy:** High-level planner uses Conflict-Based Search (CBS) on a time-indexed A* grid (0.5 m resolution), replanning at 20 Hz with formation compression primitives.
- **Key Hyperparameters:**
  - Grid Resolution: 0.5 m
  - Replanning Frequency: 20 Hz
  - CBS Iteration Limit: 50
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Success Rate: 80%
  - Mission Time: 53.7 s
  - RMS Formation Error: 1.10 m
- **Observations:**  
  Precise and fast with tight formation, but computationally intensive and sensitive to replanning failures; clearances can be as tight as 1.2 cm.

#### Decentralized Approach
- **Script:** `mission_stage4_decentralised.py`
- **Control Strategy:** Each agent uses Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance (ORCA) to compute collision-free velocities, with a soft formation constraint (bias = 0.1).
- **Key Hyperparameters:**
  - ORCA Time Horizons (Agent/Obstacle): 6 s / 4 s
  - ORCA Agent Radius: 0.625 m
  - Formation Bias: 0.1
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Success Rate: 60%
  - Mission Time: 93.3 s
  - RMS Formation Error: 7.11 m
- **Observations:**  
  Lightweight and safe with larger clearances (1.9 cm), but local-only reasoning yields lower success rate and significant formation drift.

# Autonomous Drones with Aruco Markers

Welcome to this tutorial in which we aim to fly both a real and simulated drone around some aruco markers! 

This tutorial is designed for the 24-25 COMP0240 Aerial Robotics: Fundamentals to Practice in Real-World Environments. 

## Contents

In this tutorial, we will be attempting the following:

1. An introduction to drones, the parts of a drone and how to build one. 
2. Drone control and the system architectures for drone flight
3. Simulating drone flight and the software architectures used
4. Detecing ARUCO Fiducial markers in real time 
5. Autonomously flying a drone around ARUCO markers in simulation
6. Autonomously flying a drone around ARUCO markers in reality
